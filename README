Enforce Schema Rules
=====================

This plugin provides a way to validate your model against databse rules 
you've already created in your schema, including column lengths for
strings,  "not null" designations, unique index constraints, and
ensuring integer input  for integer columns.

The four methods currently supported are: 

	enforce_column_limits
	enforce_integer_columns
	enforce_not_null
	enforce_unique_indexes

You can also just call <tt>enforce_schema_rules</tt> to enforce all the
above.

Accepts the relevant validates_length_of options (i.e. :on and :message)
and these assume the usual defaults.

In addition to the regular options, you can also have an
<tt>:except</tt> list enumerating the column that you don't want to
validate. 

By default, magic columns (_at, _on, _id, id, position, etc) are
skipped. If  you'd like to override that behavior, you can define your
own  <tt>:exclusion_regexp</tt>

Examples:

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    enforce_schema_rules :except => :dhh
  end

  class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    enforce_column_limits :message => "exceeds the %d character limit", :on => :update
    enforce_unique_indexes
    enforce_not_null :exclusion_regexp => /$fk_/
  end

Todo
----
The main goal was recent updates was to get it to work in Rails 3. Some
cleanup was just a side-effect. If anybody is interested, additional
cleanup items include:

  * Make sure we don't need better test coverage. The upgrades to
    Rails 3 caused some test fixes but I am not sure we have coverage so
    a good eye towards that would be good.
  * The smallest number of changes were done to get things working under
    Rails 3. This plugin was written a while back. It might could be
    refactored using some new goodness that comes with a more recent
    ActiveRecord/Rails implementation.
  * I most likely dropped support for Rails 2.x. The old version works
    fine for those still on Rails 2.x so I say we just drop Rails 2.x
    support (there are some warnings but they can be fixed fairly easily
    and don't need to be fixed).

The plugin was written by Josh Starcher <josh.starcher@gmail.com>. It
was updated to Rails 3 by Eric Anderson <eric@pixelwareinc.com>. This
plugin is basically an extension of David Easley's enforce-limits
plugin. Michael Schuerig provided contributed a patch and a syle lesson.
